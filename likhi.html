			Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
			How I wonder what you are.<br>
			Up above the world so high,<br>
			Like a diamond in the sky.<br><br>
			
			When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
			When he nothing shines upon,<br>
			Then you show your little light,<br>
			Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br><br>
			
			Then the traveler in the dark<br>
			Thank you for your tiny spark,<br>
			He could not see which way to go,<br>
			If you did not twinkle so.<br><br>
			
			In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
			And often through my curtains peep,<br>
			For you never shut your eye,<br>
			Till the sun is in the sky.<br><br>
			
			As your bright and tiny spark,<br>
			Lights the traveler in the dark.<br>
			Though I know not what you are,<br>
			Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
